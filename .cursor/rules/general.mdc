This is a minimalist site with a blog collection.

It is based on Astro without much customization, and posts are written in MDX.

When writing posts or changing templates, layouts etc. use the Playwright MCP server to see what the changes look like.

Run the `npm run dev` command to start the dev server which is hosted at http://localhost:4321
